2.Create a variable price and assign it the value 99.99. What is the data type of price?


3.Assign the value 15 to a variable x and the value 4 to a variable y. What is the value of x % y?


4.Create a variable width and assign it the value 7. Create another variable height and assign it the value 12. Multiply width and height and store the result in a variable called area.


5.Create a variable score and assign it the value 85. Add 15 to score and store the result in a variable called totalScore.
